        The Twitter insider Peiter Zatko
      </a>
    
        <p>
          The Twitter insider Peiter Zatko has "blown the whistle" about the amount of fake accounts that the Twiiter corporation has tried to pass off as real. This was a huge reason as to why Elon Musk decided to end his agreement to purchase Twitter outright for $44 billion dollars. Part of the initial agreement for this purchase was for Twitter to disclose the amount of fake and spam accounts that were registered in Twitter. Elon Musk has emphatically decided that he was mislead by the initial disclosure by Twitter who decided to sue him over what they percieved as market manipulation over the price, or at worst, just trying to drive the overall evaluation of Twitter into the ground. However, Peiter Zatko's coming forwared with further information has decidedly shown that maybe the company WAS lying all along. It looks like the best of this battle is yet to come, and will be decided in court.
