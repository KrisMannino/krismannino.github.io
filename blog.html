        The Twitter insider Peiter Zatko
      </a>
    
        <p>
          The Twitter insider Peiter Zatko has "blown the whistle" about the amount of fake accounts that the Twiiter corporation has tried to pass off as real. This was a huge reason as to why Elon Musk decided to end his agreement to purchase Twitter outright for $44 billion dollars. Part of the initial agreement for this purchase was for Twitter to disclose the amount of fake and spam accounts that were registered in Twitter. Elon Musk has emphatically decided that he was mislead by the initial disclosure by Twitter who decided to sue him over what they percieved as market manipulation over the price, or at worst, just trying to drive the overall evaluation of Twitter into the ground. However, Peiter Zatko's coming forwared with further information has decidedly shown that maybe the company WAS lying all along. It looks like the best of this battle is yet to come, and will be decided in court.

        Intel broke ground on a $20 billion chipmaking plant in Ohio

        <p>
          To fight what has been the major stallworth in most of the manufacturing delays during the pandemic, the United States decided has finally commited to producing semiconducters within it's borders as opposed to importing them.  TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconducter Manufacturing Company currently accounts for 92% of all semiconducters produced. When the pandemic hit and imports became latent at best, the United States realized quickly this was a flaw in major production operations. Outside of the automobile industry, it was quickly realized that in the future being dependent on one source of such a vital component to all electronics would at best be a burden, due to the increasing tensional relationship with China, and at worst a disaster. The problem is... building a semicoducter plant is intangably expensive and the construction takes multiple years to complete. It is a hard sell to write a check for $20 billion on a good day, let alone promising that this will be integral to the encompassing future of technology in this country. Somehow, the check has been written, the site has been picked, and the sooner they break the ground the better. This will not only advance the local economy of Columbus Ohio, this is also a broad spectrum step forward to the United States becoming a major player in not only technology but technology production moving forward.

        Biden administration imposes sweeping tech restrictions on China

          In a "sweeping set of export controls" the Biden administration put into effect China will not be able to use "certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US tools". This is an action to try to stall the latest surge of China's millitary and technological might. Ideally this will sway the few semicoducter manufacturing plants from dealing as much with China in order to sway them more to US interests. The immediate impact will be on exports of these tools from nine different firms in the US, namely KLA, Lam, Applied Materials, Nvidia and AMD. AMD and Nvidia were also sent formal letters of the new policy. “We recognize that the unilateral controls we’re putting into place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don’t join us,” one official said. The US hopes this will immediatley put pressure on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TMSC),the largest semicoducter manufacturer on the planet. Initial reporting by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/taiwan-signals-its-chip-firms-will-follow-new-us-rules-china-2022-10-08/">Reuters</a> signals that Taiwan will comply with these controls in order to stem the flow of microproccesors from China to Russia to support their ongoing war against Ukraine, and stall the progress of China's technology giant Huawei.
