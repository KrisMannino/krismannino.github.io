        long controlled more than 50 percent of all wealth, but that proportion has grown steadily over the past two decades, according to new research from economists at the Federal Reserve. Just 1 in 100 Americans now own 31 percent of all wealth in the country, 
        and the top 10 percent owns 70 percent of all wealth. Meanwhile, one half of Americans with the lowest wealth have paltry assets: just 1.2 percent of the total."(Clemens, 2019)</p>

      <p>There is myth that raising wages will simply drain the pockets of the “haves”.  The counterpoint to that argument is that once the “have-nots” no longer have any money to spend on goods or products, where will the “haves” 
        be able to gain any capital from.  A living wage is a necessity 
        for any society to continue to be functional.  Bleeding dry the population can only sustain itself 
        for so long before we turn into a feudal state and have to rely on other economies or exploiting natural resources here or abroad in order to gain any wealth.
        A living wage and equal taxing of “workers” in the United States is the only way to keep the economy in this country stable now, and in the foreseeable future.  Without legislation to tax the rich and implement social plans such as affordable housing, 
        food availability, and social security programs this country will fall into a failed state and a complete oligarchy.

      <p>In a large part people are fed up.  The pandemic of 2020 and its ensuing work shut downs gave people time and in a large part financial stability to reduce their 
        will to go back to work.  One sector of society has continued to call this laziness, 
        why should I pay taxes to support someone who will not “pull themselves up by their bootstraps?”  The futility to going back to living to work as opposed to working to live is the main drive behind this 
        “great resignation”.  Many people who stepped away from the grind of society realized this was no 
        longer manageable for them and decided to reassert their efforts into pursuing furthering their education**, chasing what really interests them as a career, or generally just not returning to an emotionally and 
        financially unfulfilling job in order not to remain the “working poor” for the rest of their lives.

      <p>The fact is that advantages exist.  For anyone (aside from Isaac up above) to celebrate that they did it all themselves is a fallacy.  Everyone needs help at some point.  Being self-made is a thinking one adopts once they have “made it”.  
        Be it through money, social status, race, or circumstance everybody becomes financially 
        successful with help of outside means.  The thinking needs to change to how we can elevate those around us in order to better ourselves as opposed to how we can use each other for our own gain.
